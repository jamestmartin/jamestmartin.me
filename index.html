  My name is James T. Martin.
  I am a programmer and moderator in <a href="https://proglangdesign.net">the programming language design community</a>.
  There, I research type theory and time-reversible computing, maintain the community website, and host a bridge between IRC and Discord via Matrix.
  I value challenging problems, and always strive to find the best solution I can.
  You can find out more about what I do on <a href="/projects">my Projects page</a>.

<p>
  In high school I wrote Java for the school's robotics competition team, taught my peers Java and Git, and mentored programming at the summer robotics camp.
In middle school, I used Unity3d to write a Minecraft clone with infinite procedurally generated worlds and networked multiplayer, and ran a somewhat popular Fallout-themed Minecraft server.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of programming, I enjoy playing music, playing D&amp;D, hiking, and skiing.
