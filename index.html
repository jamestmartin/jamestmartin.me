<p>
  My name is James. I am a programmer from Renton, Washington.
  I additionally serve as an administrator in <a href="https://proglangdesign.net">the programming language design community</a>.
  I have been programming since I was 7 years old.
</p>
<p>
  I am fascinated by languages: human, computer, mathematical, and musical.
  I love abstractions, but try to keep it simple and not get carried away with them.
</p>
<p>
  I don't have much to say about myself; I'm stil ltrying to figure out who I am in life.
  You can check out <a href="/projects/">a few of the things I did in the past</a>.
