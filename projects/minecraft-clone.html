    <h2>Minecraft Clone</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    In 2014, while still in middle school,
    I wrote a Minecraft clone using the Unity game engine and C#.
    It featured:
  <ul>
    <li>a first-person interactive editable world (duh),
    <li>infinite procedural map generation using simplex noise,
    <li>and a custom TCP-based multiplayer protocol.
  </ul>
  <p>
    I wrote all of the code myself, from scratch, except for one thing: the mesh generation.
    For that, I began with a mesh generator and optimizer someone else wrote,
    and slowly replaced it with my own code as I learned how it worked.
    Ultimately, my code even produced better meshes
    because my algorithm understood the greater context of the game world better (like chunk boundaries).
  <p>
    This was one of my favorite projects. I was very proud of it as a middle schooler.
    Disappointingly, I lost the code when I deleted my old email address,
    which made me lose access to my private BitBucket repositories.
