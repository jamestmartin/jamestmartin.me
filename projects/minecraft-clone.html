  In 2014, while still in middle school, I wrote a Minecraft clone using the Unity game engine and C#.
  It featured:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a first-person interactive editable world (duh),</li>
  <li>infinite procedural map generation using simplex noise,</li>
  <li>and a custom TCP-based multiplayer protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I wrote all of the code myself, from scratch, except for one thing: the mesh generation.
  For that, I began with a mesh generator and optimizer someone else wrote,
  and slowly replaced it with my own code as I learned how it worked.
  Ultimately, my code even produced better meshes
  because my algorithm understood the greater context of the game world better (like chunk boundaries).
</p>
<p>
  This was one of my favorite projects. I was very proud of it as a middle schooler.
  Disappointingly, I lost the code when I deleted my old email address,
  which made me lose access to my private BitBucket repositories.
