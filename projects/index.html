        <p>
          I have worked on many things over the years.
          Most of them have been lost to time; many, I've forgotten about entirely.
          I learned to keep backups the hard way.
          Here are some of the highlights (that I can remember):

      <ul>
        <li><a href="minecraft-clone">A minecraft clone</a>, with infinite procedural worlds and multiplayer.
        <li><a href="the-mining-dead">The Mining Dead</a>, a Fallout-themed zombie apocalypse Minecraft server, based on a custom modpack and a ton of custom code.
        <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zeusoflightning/">Scratch projects</a> from elementary school, because why not? Man, I've come a <em>long</em> way as a programmer since then.
