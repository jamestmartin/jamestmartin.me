      <p>
        Unfortunately, I had to learn to keep backups the hard way, so all of my pre-2016 code has been lost.

    <ul>
      <li>In elementary school, I made <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zeusoflightning/">Scratch projects</a>. I've come a <em>long</em> way since then.
      <li>In middle school, I ran The Mining Dead, a Fallout-themed zombie apocalypse Minecraft server. I learned Java by writing custom plugins for it.
      <li>After that, I wrote an unnamed minecraft clone, with infinite procedural worlds and online multiplayer, written in C# using the Unity game engine.
