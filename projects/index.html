      <h3>Previous</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked on many things over the years.
        Most of them have been lost to time; many, I've forgotten about entirely.
        I learned to keep backups the hard way.
        Here are some of the highlights (that I can remember):

    <ul>
      <li><a href="minecraft-clone">A minecraft clone</a>, with infinite procedural worlds and multiplayer.
      <li><a href="the-mining-dead">The Mining Dead</a>, a Fallout-themed zombie apocalypse Minecraft server, based on a custom modpack and a ton of custom code.
      <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zeusoflightning/">Scratch projects</a> from elementary school, because why not? Man, I've come a <em>long</em> way as a programmer since then.
    </ul>
