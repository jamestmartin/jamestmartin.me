      <h2>The Mining Dead</h2>
      <p>This page is a work in progress.
      <p>
        This is also from a very long time ago (2012), so my recall is pretty poor,
        which makes it especially difficult to write this article.

    <p>
      The Mining Dead was a series of loosely Fallout-themed Minecraft zombie apocalyse servers,
      featuring high spawns, difficult zombies, radiation, solar flares, decayed cities,
      a desert world generation without trees, crops, animals, grass, or dirt,
      custom player ranks based on zombie kills, a special radio chat system,
      a custom Technic Platform modpack, and a lot of rotten flesh.
      Among other things.
    <p>
      Aside from being some of the most fun I've had in my life,
      my takeover of the server's administration and codebase in 2012
      was what kickstarted my programming career and love for Debian GNU/Linux.
      I would not be the person I am today without it.
    <p>
      This is my loose attempt at a server chronology.
      This was all a long time ago, so I'm mixing up the order of things a lot.
    <ul>
      <li>The original server was founded by Skuli_Steinulf in beta 1.8.
      <li>
        The Tekkit Classic server was founded by Skuli.
        The server had three worlds (inventories were not shared):
        <ul>
          <li>The Outlands: The conventional Mining Dead experience.
          <li>The Frontier: A zombie apocalyse world with normal terrain generation and no radiation.
          <li>Medieval: A standard Tekkit Classic world.
        </ul>
      <li>A short-lived Tekkit Lite server or something might've been in here?
      <li>Skuli had early access to the Technic Platform. He creates a custom modpack for the server.
      <li>
        Skuli simultaneously founds a vanilla server,
        and another server using the custom modpack featuring the Cogs of the Machine mod
        instead of more conventional high-tech mods like IndustrialCraft 2.
      <li>
        Skuli abruptly retires from maintaining The Mining Dead.
        I had no programming experience and no experience with running Minecraft servers,
        but I took over anyway. I learn as I go.
      <li>
        TODO: The rest of the chronology, including my multiple servers, the DJ incident,
        Skuli's second attempt and the ice worlds, the various attempts to succeed me,
        Skuli's later servers, other servers I made, and Obamallama's servers.
    </ul>
