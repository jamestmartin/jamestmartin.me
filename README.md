This is the source code for my personal website, [https://jamestmartin.me](jamestmartin.me).

## Code Conventions
All of my code is valid HTML5 and CSS3 according to ["https://html.spec.whatwg.org"](WHATWG standards)

I follow the ["https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html"](Google HTML/CSS Style Guide).
Google recommends dropping optional tags wherever possible;
I know how to write valid XHTML as well, but choose not to as per the style guide.
